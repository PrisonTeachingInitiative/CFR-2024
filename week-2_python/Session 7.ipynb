    "## Tutorial: Loops and Conditionals in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to use loops and conditionals in Python. Loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple times, and conditionals allow you to make decisions in your code. By combining loops, conditionals, and NumPy arrays, you can perform complex operations efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "- Understand `for` and `while` loops\n",
    "- Use conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to make decisions\n",
    "- Apply loops and conditionals to arrays with NumPy\n",
    "- Solve practice problems to reinforce your understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "- Basic knowledge of Python variables, functions, and arrays\n",
    "- Familiarity with NumPy\n",

    "### 1.1 `for` Loop\n",
    "The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or array).\n",

    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for variable in sequence:\n",
