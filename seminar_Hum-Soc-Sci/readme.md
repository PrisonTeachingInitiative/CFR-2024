# README
This folder is intended for notebooks and workshop materials for the CFR 2024 Monday lunchtime series: Coding in the Humanities and Social Sciences. 

To keep this organized, please create a folder for your materials using the following naming convention `MMDD_LASTNAME`. Small, text-based datasets used in the workshop may be added directly to the repository but please refrain from adding large files.

Please reachout to Marion Alberty (malberty@princeton.edu) with technical or curriculum-related questions.
